### Ygor Lazaro 👋
### [Gato Ninja's CEO](http://www.gatoninja.com.br)

I am moved by curiosity, it brought me here. Wherever I passed by I could quickly learn new solutions to problems and implement it in an optimal way. 

I live with computers since I was 9 years old. At the age of 12, I was developing small games and applications, and when I was 14 I built an [operating environment, a layer above MS-DOS](https://github.com/ygorlazaro/osb).

I am happy because I work with technologies I like.

Specializations: Software Developer, ASP.Net, Windows Forms, JavaScript, TypeScript, Vue.JS, SQL Server, .NET Core, React, React Native, Node. 

I received the Microsoft Five Start Developer Certification.
